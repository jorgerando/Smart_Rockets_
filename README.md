A famous and simple genetic algorithm that consists of a series of autonomous agents in finding a way to the goal on at the top of the screen.
The individuals that come closest to the goal at the end of time will be the fittest individuals of a generation and will be the ones most likely to reproduce to produce the next generation (the fittest individual at each time is indicated by the red circle :red_circle: ) , on the other hand, in reproduction, a mutation factor is added in such a way that evolution can exist.

## First :baby: and last generation :older_man: :
